What's it all about? 

My name is Dominique. I would like to share a great tool that helps us gain more responsibility in our lives.

Bitcoin is for the individual. It is neither issued by governments nor printed by banks. It’s created by wasting a lot of electricity in a race to solve a mathematical puzzle. It’s secured by many equal nodes voluntarily connected to the network regardless of geographic location.

Bitcoin teaches responsibility.
